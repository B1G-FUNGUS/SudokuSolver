Welcome to **SudokuSolver**, an open source program to verify Sudoku board-states.

The binary can be found in the "Release" folder in the form of a ".jar" file.
It should work with a Java Runtime Environment version 8 or above, and it should be compatible with Windows, MacOS, and Linux.

The source code can be found in the "Source" folder.
If you want to compile it using the makefile, run `make SudokuSolver.jar`.
This requires GNU Make, and was tested on linux with version 4.3.
However, there shouldn't be any problems with using slightly older versions or compiling the progam on windows.
Since it is fairly simple, you can try compiling the source code with a program of your choice, if you'd like.
Compilation should work with version 8 or above of the Java Development Kit.
